date[MJD]: float        #Date of when the image was taken, in MJD format
date_err: float         #Error in the date, in units of days (for binned images / data points)
telescope: str          #Either 'A' for Australian, 'S' for South African, or 'C' for Chilean
band: str               #Either 'B', 'V', or 'I'
M_0: float              #Uncorrected magnitude
M_0_err: float          #Uncorrected magnitude error
M_0_lim: float          #Uncorrected limiting magnitude
M_C: float              #Color corrected magnitude
M_C_err: float          #Color corrected magnitude error
M_C_lim: float          #Color corrected limiting magnitude
M_E: float              #Color and extinction corrected magnitude
M_E_err: float          #Color and extinction corrected magnitude error
M_E_lim: float          #Color and extinction corrected limiting magnitude
binned: str             #Whether or not the data point was binned; either 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no
binned_images: str      #If the data point was binned, this column lists the images which were binned to obtain that data point; the image names are separated by '/' and are listed by date and telescope
