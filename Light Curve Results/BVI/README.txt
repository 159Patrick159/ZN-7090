This directory contains the most updated version of the BVI light curves of SN KSP-ZN7090.
The light curve is stored as a CSV file, which can be easily parsed with the Pandas library in
Python. The filename of the light curve file is KSP-ZN7090_LC_20220309_correct.csv. This file
was created on March 9, 2022, hence the filename.
