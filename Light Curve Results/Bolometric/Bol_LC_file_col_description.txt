Column Descriptions and Types for SN KSP-ZN7090 Bolometric Light Curve files.
The bolometric light curves were constructed using the bolometric corrections method in 
Lyman et al. (2013): https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt2187

date: datetime.datetime #Date of when the image was taken, in Python datetime.datetime format
date[MJD]: float        #Date of when the image was taken, in MJD format
date_err: float         #Error in the date, in units of days (for binned images / data points)
m_bol: float            #Apparent bolometric magnitude
m_bol_err: float        #Apparent bolometric magnitude error
M_bol: float            #Absolute bolometric magnitude, assuming z=0.1
M_bol_err: float        #Absolute bolometric magnitude error, assuming z=0.1
L_cgs: float            #Bolometric luminosity in CGS units, assuming z=0.1
L_cgs_err: float        #Bolometric luminosity error in CGS units, assuming z=0.1
L_SI: float             #Bolometric luminosity in SI units, assuming z=0.1
L_SI_err: float         #Bolometric luminosity error in SI units, assuming z=0.1
