Results Section:
- Characterization of light curves
	- V band decline rate
	- Peak magnitudes
	- Comparison between other known SNe

On SBO Theory
SBO and Post-Break out cooling emission are sensitive to
	- Progenitor Radius
	- Ratio of ejecta energy and ejecta mass
	- Opacity
This early stage of light curve is independent of density profiles of progenitor
