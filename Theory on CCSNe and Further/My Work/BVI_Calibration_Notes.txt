KMTNet:
BV are in Johnson
I is calibrated wrt i (Sloan)
Mathew made correction for I -> i
Mag difference with two filters (offset of 0.4mag)
I and i are not interchangeable (apply conversion between filters)


To improve
Be more descriptive in figures, X
Reference files where data comes from X
Be more quantitative with choosing the bolometric correction
Mention I/i filter difference X
Inlcude more equation (bolometric corrections) X
Power law fitting! X

If have time:
estimate physical parameters
