Meeting Notes:

2022-06-17
- Implement polynomial fitting to color and bolometric correction plots
	- This will help smoothing the bolometric light and improve errors
- Write up results descriptively
- Explain why I chose 2D power fit over all other options (HO extrapolation is not frequently seen in literature due to its prone to divergence)
- Read observational papers on SNe and learn how they apply theoretical models to observations

2022-06-21
- Read on papers of Type II-L SNe
	- Prepare a summary on this ^
- Read on paper on theory and models for Type II-SNe LC
- Read on observation papers on SNe and learn how models are applied to observations
- Clearly define research goals (parameters I need to calculate) 
- Use a Z=0.1 for models (make functions automatic) in case we need to change Z
